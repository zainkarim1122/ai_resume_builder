🏗️ ZNA - AI Resume Architect
Python Streamlit Gemini AI Status

ZNA AI Resume Architect is a next-generation, LLM-powered career document synthesizer designed to help professionals and students build ATS-optimized resumes, generate highly targeted cover letters, and analyze job descriptions using Semantic NLP.

Developed as a Final Year Computer Science Engineering Project.

✨ Core Features
🤖 Dual-Mode Smart Resume Builder: * Auto-Parse Engine: Simply paste raw LinkedIn profile data or rough notes, and the AI will automatically extract, format, and categorize the information.
Structured Manual Entry: A granular form-based input for users who want precise control over every detail.
🎨 Dynamic Style Templates: Instantly format the output into distinct professional styles: Standard Corporate, Executive & Leadership, Creative & Tech, or Academic & Research.
📄 Smart PDF Export: Automatically compiles the AI-generated text into a clean, ATS-friendly PDF. Contact details (Email, Phone, LinkedIn, GitHub) are automatically injected as clickable blue hyperlinks in the document header.
✉️ Auto-Cover Letter Generator: Contextually generates highly persuasive, sub-350-word cover letters by mapping the user's active resume data against a specific target company and job description.
🔍 Semantic ATS Match Engine: Uses deep NLP to compare the generated resume against a raw Job Description (JD). It calculates a match score, identifies missing crucial keywords, and provides actionable recommendations.
🌐 Live Job Portal Integration: Dynamically generates a direct LinkedIn job search query based on the user's target role.
💎 Premium UI/UX: Features a custom, glassmorphism-styled dark mode interface with interactive metrics and live system logs.
